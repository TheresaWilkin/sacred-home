        <h2>Virtual Trick or Treating!</h2>
        <p>
          This year, we'll be taking our trick-or-treating
          <strong>virtual</strong> to protect our community during the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each participant will send out twelve small bags of candy, and get the
          same number of different bags back. On Halloween, we'll do a video
          call where the kids get to do different activities to get to the
          different "houses" and open their next little bag. We'll follow this
          with time to hang out and chat with the other kids and show off their
          rocking costumes! See the Signup Genius for more details.

          and in that spirit, anyone is welcomed to join the
