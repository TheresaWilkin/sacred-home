    <h2>Annual Tarot and Runes Fundraiser!</h2>
    <p>Sacred Home Pagan Community relies on our annual fundraiser to pay for
        ritual supplies and location rental. This year, we've taken our Tarot
        and Rune readings <strong>virtual</strong> to protect our community during
        the pandemic.</p>
    <p>$10 for a 20 minute reading.</p>
